Basic setup to allow the sending of messages to a computer remotely.

Requires Hogan (see https://github.com/Rosuav/Hogan) and Pike.

Pretty stubby at the moment. Not currently in use.

Login credentials and such are found in config.txt, not part of the repo. It's
a simple "name=value" text file, and so far undocumented; check the code for
what can (and what must be) set.

Pigeon needs to:
* Receive external alerts - probably by email
* Avoid spam - there'll be criteria like "must have this word in the subject" or "must be sent envelope-from this domain"
* Pop up, obviously
* Grab attention

Possibilities:
* IMAP notification
* Always-On-Top window with the urgency hint set, vs Presented window
* Can I programmatically put the window on all workspaces?? Actually, probably no need; a new window will be on the current workspace.
