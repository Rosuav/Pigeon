There's no code here, but this repo is collecting my notes.

Pigeon needs to:
* Receive external alerts - probably by email
* Avoid spam - there'll be criteria like "must have this word in the subject" or "must be sent envelope-from this domain"
* Pop up, obviously
* Grab attention

Possibilities:
* IMAP notification
* Always-On-Top window with the urgency hint set, vs Presented window
* Can I programmatically put the window on all workspaces?? Actually, probably no need; a new window will be on the current workspace.
